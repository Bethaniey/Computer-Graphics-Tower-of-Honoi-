# Computer-Graphics-Tower-of-Honoi-
In this assignment, a 3D model of Tower of Hanoi is designed by using OpenGL. The Tower of Hanoi is made up of 3 rods and 3 disks of different sizes. The puzzle starts with the disks arranged according to their size in a neat stack on the left most rod, where the smallest disk is on top. The goal of this game is that the user must move the stack of disks from the first rod to any other rod but with the following rules: only one disks can be move at one time and no bigger disk can be put on a smaller disk. To build the model for the Tower of Hanoi game, our group will be using lighting, shading and some other effects to make it attractive.
